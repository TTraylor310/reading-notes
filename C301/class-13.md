## [Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNcBhSv1Wo)

1. What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
    * REST uses the HTTP protocol’s request types (POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE) to allow users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) via an API.
2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
    1. Install depencies after you create the files. (NPM init -y)
    2. Write base code for the Create/Update/Get/ Delete
    3. Set up DB to connect to front, create schema
    4. create base information to show up, question and response
    5. validate the data on back end and deploy server
