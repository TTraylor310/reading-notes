## [SQL vs NoSQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

1. Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases
    1. SQL is table based databases : NoSQL is in documents, graph, or wide columns
    2. SQL verticle stable : NoSQL horizontal
    3. SQL predefined schema : NoSQL is dynamic
    4. SQL is better for complex queries
    5. SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )
2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    * complex query intensive environment
3. Give a real world example.
    * MySQL community Edition [MySQL database](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/07/howto-install-mysql-on-linux/)
4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    * hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair
5. Give a real world example.
    * Mongodb
6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    * NoSQL
7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    * mostly SQL

1. What does SQL stand for?
    * Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?
    * works with assumptions, lets records connect to other related data
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
    * Tables
4. What is a ‘schema’?
    * is fields which allow you to sort and get new info
5. What is a NoSQL database?
    * MongoDB
6. How does it work?
    * has databases, and inside Collections -> Documents
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
    * Do not use same schema
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why
    * Mongo, you don't need to have all the data in database set
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    * Hard to know if you don't have complete data
