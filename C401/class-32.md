## Resources

## [Hooks and Context example](https://medium.com/swlh/snackbars-in-react-an-exercise-in-hooks-and-context-299b43fd2a2b)

1. With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do?
    - allows access to information on a global (intentional) area to be accessed
2. With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role?
    - bring in the info that is 'provided' in order to use as a Hook
3. Specifically with Context, how are we “wrapping” components to achieve our goals?
    - using the basic info and covered by specific code in the scenario to provide context in the designated information

## [Awesome React Context links](https://github.com/diegohaz/awesome-react-context)

1. Consume content from (at least) two more of the Awesome React Context links. After some familiarity with React Context, once again share your takeaways from each:
  - Takeaway 1: Take care of how to bring information into the child and where that information is being manipulated and updated to state.
  - Takeaway 2: Consumers and Providers must be set up to work in tandem in order to provide accurate information and show the update. Ensure that the correct information is updated and displayed when called

## Additional Questions

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
