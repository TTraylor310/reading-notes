### Writeup

  Stacks and Nodes are like used with Push and Pop to add and removed from top of the stack. We can look at the next one and iterate through the stack like a Linked List. It is basically the same and we can add and remove from the top (or some spot) which is an O(1) action and will require the same computing power regardless of the location in the stack or the length of the queue.
