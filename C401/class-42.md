## [Amazon Works Demand Jeff Bezos Cancel Face Recognition Contracts with Law Enforcement](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-workers-demand-jeff-bezos-cancel-face-recognitio-1827037509)

This is a good article in showing what power companies have and what little say people have in these spaces. I think the question that first comes to mind is surrounding the legality. The topic 'ethics' is pretty broad and can encompass lots of different things but for this article, the point of contention for me was should that information Amazon has be shared with government projects or services. As I understand it, the information collected belongs to the company? I think we need to have a discussion about what information 'belongs' to a company. Because you work for said company, do they have right to access my fingerprints? Or Facial structure? Voice recordings? I don't think that it should be a company's default to say yes to any of these things. In no other time was my personal information able to be sold by someone else than right now. Works who feel that technology is being misused because information has been gathered without consent is important, but how a company uses that information. Well, if the company is public, information should be above public reproach, otherwise it should be liable for damages caused x1000. If it's not painful what is the deterrent?

## [Bit data is our generation's civil rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)

The discussion starts out talking about Data and how we use what we collect. The information is already out there and ready to be used but how to make it useful is difficult. Sometimes the data is just collected and then determined what to use it for. "Schema-less query" collecting and THEN deciding what to do with it. Profiling and Personalization and Targeting are words which give a score or a pre-judgement to people so we can target and show them adds or information which is most likely to get a response or sale. Who should regulate this information? I'm not sure that I trust what big government is going to do with that same information. Who should control that info or even have access to it. The information being stored because we hit the 'accept' button without reading the fine print. In the age of technology we have exchanged simplicity and availability for our little regarded privacy. The train has just left the station.
