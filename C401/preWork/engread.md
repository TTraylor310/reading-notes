## Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    * My background in nuclear electrical theory and my time as a electrical supervisor has given me a good lens for troubleshooting problems from a logical and methodical standpoint
2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    * READ THE INFO AGAIN
    * try to make it work on a smaller piece of code
    * take a break if it's been awhile, then start over fresh. Maybe the issue isn't really an issue
