# Notes for Class 01

## [Review if helpful: Intro to Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
    * Program interface which allows the developer to script the user's interaction with the website. All the events are determined previously or are reactions to the user's input on the site.
2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
    * It's a program which allows the JavaScript language to run on. Kind of interface for language to cpu.
3. What is Node used for?
    * Allows us to run JavaScript that can wait for user input and give a callback function. Attaches API library's and other components to maximize interface capabilities.

### Things I want to know more about

* Priorities for multiple events and how complex can the event be?
