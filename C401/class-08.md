1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
    * the idea that roles are based on the needs that you have within an organization
2. Describe a Role/Permission hierarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
    * Records that maintenance technicians have access to but the managers have access to different levels in order to change different requirements for the subordinate
3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
    * take inventory of staff and requirements for information and what level they need access to. It all depends on the level of requirements and associations with the information kept.
