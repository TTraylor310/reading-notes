# Reading Notes

*This is where I will put all my notes I guess...*

Hello, My name is Tim Traylor (he/him). Currently living in Edmonds, Washington. I am a 12 year Navy veteran, submarine nuclear electrician. Currently running Windows 10. Excited to see what area of coding and software development speaks to me next. I have enjoyed learning JavaScript and look forward to more complexity in code and projects. Starting from a near zero background in coding, but have always been able to build computers and fix small issues. Excited to continue learning with Code Fellows!

Please, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/ttraylor310) and/or [GitHub](https://github.com/ttraylor310).

**Growth mindset** is the idea that I know that I am constantly growing and learning. *It is okay to fail*, but never okay to quit. Continue to improve daily and a month from now, you will be surprised.

<!-- ### Various Notes for Markdown
<!-- Good for commenting your Markdown AND blocking out Markdown that you don't want rendered. -->
<!-- Markdown is useful for Styling Text:

1. **Two asterisks make it Bold**  
2. _One underscore is Italic_  
3. **_Three asterisks are both Bold and Italic_** -->

## Reminders to stay in Growth Mindset

* Nothing comes easy
* Try to remember every one started at square one
* Focus on small wins, win the war
